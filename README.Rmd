A sentence contains several words, possibly with some commas. 

```{r}
sentence(meat)
```

A paragraph contains several sentences. 

```{r}
paragraph( meat )
paragraph( cran_package_names() )
```

Then we can put paragraphs together with `prose`

```{r}
prose(meat, n = 3)
prose(cran_package_names(), n = 5)
```
